abstract = {A model of plasma oscillations in the presence of small-angle collisions is presented which admits of exact analytic solution. Certain features of the true collision terms are preserved. Namely, the effect of collisions is represented by a diffusion in velocity space, which makes the distribution function tend to the Maxwell distribution, and which conserves the number of particles. In the limit of infrequent collisions the results of Landau are recovered.},

@article{Dougherty1964,
abstract = {A model Fokker-Planck equation for a single species of particles in a plasma is discussed. This equation has several properties in common with the real equation, and ascribes an approximately correct behavior to most of the particles, though incorrect for the high-energy tail in the thermal distribution. It is shown that the equation can be solved completely, for the small perturbations of a uniform plasma by electric fields harmonic in space and time, in an external magnetic field. Applications to ionospheric radar scattering are briefly discussed; it is shown that in certain circumstances, ion-ion collisions can have a profound effect on the scattering even though the collision frequency is much smaller than the ion gyrofrequency, and this appears to agree with observation.},
